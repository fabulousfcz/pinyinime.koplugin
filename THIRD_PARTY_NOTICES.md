## Rime pinyin-simp exact and abbreviation data

The files `data/pinyin_data.lua` and `data/pinyin_abbr_data.lua`, and the base
candidates retained in the merged abbreviation table of
`data/phrase_overlay.lua`, contain exact and initials-based Simplified Chinese
pinyin data generated from
[`rime/rime-pinyin-simp`](https://github.com/rime/rime-pinyin-simp).

- Upstream license: Apache License 2.0
- Imported through: `koreader/koreader` pull request #15610
- Pinned KOReader commit: `66ef609fbc5eab059ee07930a71f4300f8d37065`

- Local change: the data remains unchanged; the input engine reads at most the
  first 10 candidates for each abbreviation.

## Apple layouts and Rime double-pinyin cross-check

The generated files `data/shuangpin_sogou_microsoft.lua`,
`data/shuangpin_pinyin_jiajia.lua`, `data/shuangpin_flypy.lua`, and
`data/shuangpin_common.lua` implement the key layouts and zero-initial rules
documented by Apple. The Apple 常用 layout is exposed as 自然码双拼 because it
matches the pinned 自然码 rules in
[`rime/rime-double-pinyin`](https://github.com/rime/rime-double-pinyin).
The other Rime schemes are used as a cross-check, and the 小鹤 map also retains
compatible alternate zero-initial codes from `double_pinyin_flypy.schema.yaml`.

- Local change: the layouts are applied at build time to the plugin's shared
  pinyin syllable inventory. Runtime decoding uses the generated two-key
  lookup tables; `m`, `n`, `ng`, and `hng` are handled by the plugin's explicit
  apostrophe escape syntax.

## Rime Ice, Jieba, and Wanxiang phrase overlay

`data/phrase_overlay.lua` contains a bounded exact-phrase overlay generated
from Rime Ice's annotated Simplified Chinese dictionaries, the Jieba
general-purpose frequency dictionary, Wanxiang's modern input-method weights,
and the plugin's explicit reading, device, input-method, and technology
allowlist. Its abbreviation table merges those additions with the Apache-2.0
pinyin-simp data documented above.

The automatic selection contains only 2–4 character Han phrases. The first
7,000 accepted automatic entries retain the existing Jieba/Rime ordering; the
remaining bounded tail uses reciprocal-rank fusion over Jieba, Rime, and
reading-matched Wanxiang ranks. Wanxiang pinyin is stripped of tone marks and
must exactly match the Rime-selected reading, so polyphonic readings are never
merged by word alone. The generated output is further bounded and
de-duplicated by code; it does not contain any complete upstream dictionary.
Source revisions, hashes, filters, source ranks, and coverage results are recorded in
`tools/phrase_overlay_report.json`, and the preferred form for modification is
the pinned source dictionaries together with `tools/generate_phrase_overlay.py`
and `tools/phrase_allowlist.tsv`.

The Rime Ice notice is in `LICENSE.rime-ice`; the complete GPL-3.0 text already
shipped by this plugin is `LICENSE.rime-double-pinyin`. The complete Jieba MIT
license is included in `LICENSE.jieba`.
The complete Wanxiang CC-BY-4.0 license is included in `LICENSE.wanxiang`.

## Academic and general vocabulary supplement

`data/academic_supplement.sqlite3` is a separate, read-only fallback database
for ordinary and academic terms. The runtime queries it only when the
byte-identical main `phrase` result contains fewer rows than the requested
candidate limit. The generated artifact contains 560,885 logical baseline rows
plus the licensed extension documented below, is 54,235,136 bytes, and has
SHA-256
`5f55c271579776d781e56fe788cd92331dee4d7deedbabec1ac0b09d870a4303`.
The unchanged parent `data/wanxiang.sqlite3` has SHA-256
`fe029542646e2cb78d1ff264d2737a8262603279df4629d6898e60266963b6d5`.

The preferred forms for modification are `tools/academic_lexicon.tsv`

The local build converts terms to Simplified Chinese, retains only 2–10 Han
characters (2–6 for the bounded Wikipedia named-concept tail), assigns the
Ministry of Education's 14-category/117-discipline taxonomy, filters invalid
readings, merges duplicate `(pinyin, text)` pairs, caps ranks at 500, and
stores only baseline-missing pairs. These are modifications; downstream
redistributors must preserve attribution, indicate modifications, provide the

## Metasequoia-inspired licensed phrase and mixed-pinyin extension

The `licensed_phrase_extension`, `mixed_candidate`, and `mixed_head` tables in
`data/academic_supplement.sqlite3`, together with `data/mixed_head.bloom`, are
modified, offline-compiled artifacts. They add 12,252 baseline-missing
`(pinyin, text)` pairs and a collision-filtered full-syllable/initial mixed
index. The Bloom file is 262,144 bytes and has SHA-256
`1623582ecc3b19e193a93882e500ddabe5db1ec9f4884976f4fa4e3ba5b6384f`.

The shipped word rows are selected only from these GPL-3.0 sources:

- [Rime Ice](https://github.com/iDvel/rime-ice), commit
  `75e6572bebc05b49021e842949ce947882e3e4b2`. The exact `LICENSE`,
  `cn_dicts/base.dict.yaml`, `cn_dicts/ext.dict.yaml`, and
  `cn_dicts/others.dict.yaml` hashes are pinned in
  `tools/metasequoia_source_manifest.json`.
- [Rime Frost](https://github.com/gaboolic/rime-frost), commit
  `7a7c311efee1d8d0884624677a1f7f99cade457f`. Only the bounded animal,
  computer, hot-term, geography, history, idiom, industry/product,
  input-method, literature, media, medication, music, and sport files listed
  in that manifest are eligible; medication additionally requires source
  weight 5 or greater.

The Rime Ice notice is included in `LICENSE.rime-ice`; it points to the complete
GPL-3.0 text already shipped as `LICENSE.rime-double-pinyin`. Rime Frost's copy
is included in `LICENSE.rime-frost`, and the plugin `LICENSE` also contains the
GPL-3.0 text. The local build keeps
only 2–8 Han-character rows with explicit, aligned, known pinyin syllables,
removes exact pairs already present in the two baseline tables, de-duplicates
by `(pinyin, text)`, and caps both ordinary and mixed candidate lists.

[MetasequoiaImeTsf](https://github.com/metasequoiaime/MetasequoiaImeTsf),
commit `ffe90560cd719a095ccd73dafa09ee370ced51c9`, is the GPL-3.0 design
reference for offline dictionary compilation and bounded length/initial
partitioning. No TSF or Server code is copied into the plugin.
[MetasequoiaImeDict](https://github.com/metasequoiaime/MetasequoiaImeDict),
commit `02b798a89c90ec79dcf923d076d871ab326f6ad3`, is used only for a
non-authoritative exact-pair analysis cross-check. Because that combined
repository does not declare a top-level redistribution license, it cannot
select, rank, or contribute any shipped row. Its
CustomPinyinDictionary-derived content is likewise excluded. The full source
boundary, file hashes, filters, and reproducible counts are recorded in
`tools/metasequoia_source_manifest.json` and the final optimization report.

## Locally authored CC0 prediction material

`tools/ai_prediction_seed.tsv` is the project's deterministic, AI-assisted,
manually reviewed prediction seed. It was authored independently of the
licensed corpora described below and is not a relicensing of DuReader or
Wanxiang text.

- Declared source: `original-ai-authored`
- License dedication: CC0-1.0, to the extent the project owns copyright or
  related rights in the material
- Generated seed SHA-256:
  `8e0879fb1fe20253133bb3f04287c72643f749e2a43a621de4f80f6217c25848`
- Seed manifest SHA-256:
  `12a1e3ef649be5bb2a9010df2dc33d6b43ccbcf13a1d189ed5e59d1e0a0ffa1c`
- Generator SHA-256:
  `b4ea711a5400735eabb0400d45f48c4ab8b07fd12d7e58da52a540e5323cf8ad`
- Size and scope: 257,472 bytes; 1,152 contexts; 4,577 relations

The preferred form for modification is
`tools/generate_ai_prediction_seed.py`; running it with `--check` verifies the
committed TSV and manifest byte-for-byte. The generator and manifest state
that validation and release-blind answers were not used to author, select, or
rank these associations. The separate development corpus is likewise declared
CC0-1.0 in `tools/prediction_corpus_manifest.json`; its development artifact
SHA-256 is
`ef82aa5e9f4679a22a662dd9d61715873c84dd1ad6618c7cf3eb2ed1caa05d98`.
Redistributors should preserve these manifests so that locally dedicated CC0
material remains distinguishable from the licensed corpus seed.

## Licensed next-text corpus distillation

`tools/corpus_prediction_seed.tsv.gz` is a modified, compressed statistical
artifact built from one licensed Chinese corpus. The raw corpus is a build
input and is not included in the plugin, but its license and attribution
requirements continue to apply to the generated seed and to prediction rows
copied from it into `data/wanxiang.sqlite3`. The artifact is not CC0.

The build tool has a tested Tatoeba parser, but the committed source manifest,
seed, and database contain no Tatoeba-derived relation. Tatoeba sentences were
excluded because the compact format does not retain the sentence ID and
individual contributor mapping required for reliable CC-BY attribution. A
future release must not add that source without preserving compliant
sentence-level provenance and attribution.

The pinned `DuReader-Robust` tree contains the copyright and Apache-2.0 notice
in its README and no separate upstream `NOTICE` file. The complete canonical
Apache License 2.0 text already shipped in this plugin is
`LICENSE.rime-pinyin-simp`; it also supplies the required license text for this
DuReader-derived component. Redistributors must preserve the Baidu copyright
notice above and mark the generated seed as modified.

Individual generated rows record aggregate support and source counts, not
per-document provenance. The seed and the database component derived from it
carry the Apache-2.0 DuReader notice above.
`tools/corpus_prediction_report.json` records filters, thresholds, input
statistics, and samples; it is a build report, not a substitute for required
attribution.

### Schema-v4/v5 candidate artifacts

Two additional aggregate-only DuReader artifacts support the release-gated
schema-v4 B/C experiment and its schema-v5 packed/transition successor. They
carry the same Apache-2.0 Baidu notice above.
They are shipped as reproducible build inputs, but the current schema-v3
`data/wanxiang.sqlite3` does not contain their rows.

Both generators verify the source manifest, raw input hashes, Wanxiang
segmentation and Simplified/Traditional-map hashes. Tuning, validation, and
release-blind paths are rejected. Only document support, occurrence counts,
quality scores, and bounded Han relations are emitted; raw questions, answers,
document identifiers, and webpage contexts are absent.

## Wanxiang full SQLite lexicon

`data/wanxiang.sqlite3` is a build-time normalized form of the Han-only entries
imported by Wanxiang's complete `wanxiang.dict.yaml` manifest. It is a
standalone, read-only database shipped and opened by this plugin; it does not
contain or access any KOReader database. “Plugin-owned” in runtime
documentation refers to file location and lifecycle, not copyright ownership
of third-party components.

- Local changes: tone marks are removed, umlaut-u is represented as `v`, syllable
  boundaries are retained with apostrophes, unsupported or common
  Traditional-only forms are filtered, duplicate `(pinyin, text)` entries are
  merged, source priors are recorded, and the existing bounded phrase overlay is
  merged as a compatibility source. Schema v3 also contains a bounded next-text
  table. Its highest-priority relations are development-only counts from this
  project's original phrase-boundary corpus, followed by an independently
  authored CC0 seed, the licensed DuReader corpus seed documented
  above, high-confidence Wanxiang `jichu` phrases, and lower-priority
  `lianxiang` splits. A separate five-row phrase layer mined from the original
  long-sentence tuning corpus is marked with its own source bit and penalty.
  These local layers add no network, model, or runtime dependency.

The database is a collective generated artifact. Its phrase and prediction
components include CC-BY-4.0 Wanxiang data, GPL-3.0 Rime Ice overlay data, MIT
Jieba overlay data, Apache-2.0 pinyin-simp and DuReader-derived data,
and locally authored CC0 prediction data. No Tatoeba-derived relation is
present in this release.
The database metadata field `license_id=CC-BY-4.0` describes the Wanxiang
lexical base only; it is not a license declaration for the entire combined
database. Redistributors must ship this notice and every applicable license
identified above, preserve attribution, and must not relicense the complete
database as CC0 or solely CC-BY-4.0.

Every imported source hash, filter count, rank sample, database size, and schema
version is recorded in `tools/wanxiang_db_report.json`. The reproducible build
inputs include `tools/wanxiang_sources.json`, `tools/ai_prediction_seed.tsv`,
`tools/ai_prediction_seed_manifest.json`,
`tools/corpus_prediction_seed.tsv.gz`,
`tools/corpus_prediction_seed_manifest.json`,
